# GoogleAdsConversionAlerts
A Google Ads MCC script for alerting on 0-conversion days, useful for tracking account errors or failures of automated offline conversion uploads.

Script will review recorded conversions (built initially for offline conversion uploads) for the previous day and alert on a threshold that can be specified in the source, as can the lookback for reporting. 

The script allows you to schedule and dispatch emails to multiple recipients when an alert is triggered, and is compatible with the new (Summer 2022) Google Ads Scripts experience.
